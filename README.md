# Sliding Window Pattern Article

> When it comes to dealing with algorithms challenges, there are some extremely useful patterns (An algorithm pattern, or algorithm paradigm, is a method, strategy, or technique of solving a problem) that will make our lives a lot easier. “Sliding Window” is a common problem solving pattern in computer science. It is most frequently used on arrays and strings. The main principle behind it is to create a “window”, and after that check if the data within the window satisfies the condition of your problem, as well as to convert two nested loops into a single loop.
